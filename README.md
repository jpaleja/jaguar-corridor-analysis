# jaguar-corridor-analysis
These scripts analyse the potential future shift in connectivity between locally critically endangered jaguar populations through corridors in Colombia. Producing a cost surface with recent and high resolution land use cover and tree loss data enabled the calculation of the cumulative cost distance between the habitats, therefore modelling the corridors. Emerging hotspot analysis demonstrated the statistically significant spatiotemporal trends of forest loss which, when incorporated with the corridors, identified the areas between Serran√≠a de San Lucas and the known surrounding jaguar habitats under most threat. The results showed that based on historical tree loss, the mean and total costs of dispersal increase in the San Lucas-Paramillo corridor and remain comparatively similar in the eastern corridor. The absence of modelled corridors to the north of San Lucas when compared with other models highlights an area with connectivity already diminishing with the influence of existing land use practices.
